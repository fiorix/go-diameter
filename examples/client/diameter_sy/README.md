# Diameter Sy interface

This example is based on go-diameter project and extention of client example to work with diameter sy interface.

`diameter_sy.xml` file containt necessory AVPs for `Spending Limit Request` and `Spending Limit Answer`.

To test the functionality, you have to use configured proper diameter sy server, for testing I have used seagull.
